# Pizza README

Have you ever gotten hungry while coding but not wanted to leave your editor since it will take you out of the flow? With this extension you can order your favorite pizza without ever leaving VSCode. This is done by using the Dominos API.

## Features

There is only one command in this extension and it is called `EMERGENCY PIZZA`. This will take you through the process of entering all your information to order a pizza. You may also use the settings listed below to automatically fill in certain information.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

In order to make ordering a pizza even quicker utilize these settings to have information automatically populated:

* `pizza.address`: Where do you want your food delivered
* `pizza.firstName`: Your first name (duh)
* `pizza.lastName`: Your last name
* `pizza.email`: Your email (it is required unfortunately)
* `pizza.phoneNumber`: Your phone number (it is also required unfortunately)
